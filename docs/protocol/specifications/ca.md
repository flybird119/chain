## Introduction

In Chain Protocol 2, asset IDs and amounts in transaction inputs and outputs can be kept private. These details are encrypted homomorphically: the network can verify that transactions are balanced (and, consequently, that the ledger is consistent) without learning exact asset IDs or amounts. Designated recipients and auditors share the encryption key that gives them “read access” to the asset ID and amount of a particular output.

Blinded amounts can be selectively revealed to the network in order to make them visible to smart contracts. The asset ID and the amount can be hidden or revealed independently enabling fine-grained privacy control.

Amounts can have *absolute privacy*, independent of the structure and history of any given transaction. Asset IDs are *relatively private*, meaning their privacy set is the union of the sets of possible asset IDs committed to by transaction inputs.

[[NOTES: Define absolute privacy. Define privacy set.]]

Cryptographic proofs for blinded asset IDs and blinded amounts require relatively large amounts of data (typically 3 to 5 KB). However, almost 80% of that space can be reused to encrypt a confidential message addressed to a designated recipient of the transaction output. The protocol specifies algorithms for encrypting and decrypting this data, along with parameters that allow the user creating the transaction to tune the size of the proofs trading off some of the privacy for lower bandwidth requirements (e.g. blinding a 32-bit amount requires half as much data compared to blinding a full-resolution 64-bit integer).

Present scheme is *perfectly binding*, but only *computationally hiding*. (In fact, [it is impossible](http://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/41822/why-cant-the-commitment-schemes-have-both-information-theoretic-hiding-and-bind) for a commitment scheme to be both perfectly binding and perfectly hiding at the same time.) This means that breaking elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP) will not compromise the integrity of the commitments, that bind the value perfectly and do not allow manipulations using any amount of computational resources. However, breaking ECDLP can compromise commitments’ hiding property, which rests on discovery of the blinding factor being computationally hard (which is the case only until a powerful quantum computer is made or there is a breakthrough in solving ECDLP with classical computers).

## Usage

In this section we will provide a brief overview of various ways to use confidential assets.

### Confidential issuance

1. Issuer chooses asset ID and an amount to issue.
2. Issuer generates issuance [REK](#record-encryption-key) unique for this issuance.
3. Issuer chooses a set of other asset IDs to add into the *issuance anonymity set*.
4. Issuer sorts the union of the issuance asset ID and anonymity set lexicographically.
5. For each asset ID, where issuance program does not check an issuance key, issuer [creates a transient issuance key](#transient-issuance-key).
6. Issuer provides arguments for each issuance program of each asset ID.
7. Issuer [encrypts issuance](#encrypt-issuance): generates asset ID and value commitments and provides necessary range proofs. Issuer uses ID of the [Nonce](blockchain.md#nonce) as `nonce` and [issuance program](blockchain.md#program) as `message`.
8. Issuer remembers values `(AC,c,f)` to help complete the transaction. Once outputs are fully or partially specified, these values can be discarded.
9. Issuer proceeds with the rest of the transaction creation. See [simple transfer](#simple-transfer) and [multi-party transaction](#multi-party-transaction) for details.

### Simple transfer

1. Recipient generates the following parameters and sends them privately to the sender:
    * amount and asset ID to be sent,
    * control program,
    * [REK1](#record-encryption-key).
2. Sender composes a transaction with an unencrypted output with a given control program.
3. Sender adds necessary amount of inputs to satisfy the output:
    1. For each unspent output, sender pulls values `(assetid,value,AC,c,f)` from its DB.
    2. If the unspent output is not confidential, then:
        * `AC=(A,O)`, [nonblinded asset ID commitment](#asset-id-commitment)
        * `c=0`
        * `f=0`
4. If sender needs to add a change output:
    1. Sender [encrypts](#encrypt-output) the first output.
    2. Sender [balances blinding factors](#balance-blinding-factors) to create an excess factor `q`.
    3. Sender adds unencrypted change output.
    4. Sender generates a [REK2](#record-encryption-key) for the change output.
    5. Sender [encrypts](#encrypt-output) the change output with an additional excess factor `q`.
5. If sender does not need a change output:
    1. Sender [balances blinding factors](#balance-blinding-factors) of the inputs to create an excess factor `q`.
    2. Sender [encrypts](#encrypt-output) the first output with an additional excess factor `q`.
6. Sender stores values `(assetid,value,AC,c,f)` in its DB with its change output for later spending.
7. Sender publishes the transaction.
8. Recipient receives the transaction and identifies its output via its control program.
9. Recipient uses its [REK1](#record-encryption-key) to [decrypt output](#decrypt-output).
10. Recipient stores resulting `(assetid,value,H,c,f)` in its DB with its change output for later spending.
11. Recipient separately stores decrypted plaintext payload with the rest of the reference data. It is not necessary for spending.


### Multi-party transaction

1. All parties communicate out-of-band payment details (how much is being paid for what), but not cryptographic material or control programs.
2. Each party:
    1. Generates cleartext outputs: (amount, asset ID, control program, [REK](#record-encryption-key)). These include both requested payment ("I want to receive €10") and the change ("I send back to myself $142").
    2. [Encrypts](#encrypt-output) each output.
    3. [Balances blinding factors](#balance-blinding-factors) to create an excess factor `q[i]`.
    4. For each output, stores values `(assetid,value,AC,c,f)` associated with that output in its DB for later spending.
    5. Sends `q[i]` to the party that finalizes transaction.
3. Party that finalizes transaction:
    1. Receives `{q[i]}` values from all other parties (including itself).
    2. Sums all excess factors: `qsum = ∑q[i]`
    3. [Creates excess commitment](#create-excess-commitment) out of `qsum`: `QG=qsum·G, QJ=qsum·J` and signs it.
    4. Finalizes transaction by placing the [excess commitment](#excess-commitment) in the transaction.
    5. Publishes the transaction.
4. If the amounts and blinding factors are balanced, transaction is valid and included in the blockchain. Parties can not see each other’s outputs, but only their own.


## Cryptographic primitives

### Elliptic curve

**The elliptic curve** is edwards25519 as defined by [[RFC7748](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7748)].

`L` is the **order of edwards25519** as defined by \[[RFC8032](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032)\] (i.e. 2<sup>252</sup>+27742317777372353535851937790883648493).

### Scalar

A _scalar_ is an integer in the range from `0` to `L-1` where `L` is the order of [edwards25519](#elliptic-curve) subgroup.
Scalars are encoded as little-endian 32-byte integers.

### Points

#### Point

A point is a two-dimensional point on [edwards25519](#elliptic-curve).
Points are encoded according to [RFC8032](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032).

#### Point Pair

A vector of two elliptic curve [points](#point). Point pair is encoded as 64-byte string composed of 32-byte encodings of each point.

#### Point operations

Elliptic curve *points* support two operations:

1. Addition/subtraction of points (`A+B`, `A-B`)
2. Scalar multiplication (`a·B`).

These operations are defined as in \[[RFC8032](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032)\].

*Point pairs* support the same operations defined as:

1. Sum of two pairs is a pair of sums:

        (A,B) + (C,D) == (A+C, B+D)

2. Multiplication of a pair by a [scalar](#scalar) is a pair of scalar multiplications of each point:

        x·(A,B) == (x·A,x·B)


#### Zero point

_Zero point_ `O` is a representation of the _point at infinity_, identity element in the [edwards25519](#elliptic-curve) subgroup. It is encoded as follows:

    O = 0x0100000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000

#### Generators

**Primary generator point** (`G`) is the elliptic curve point specified as "B" in Section 5.1 of [[RFC8032](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032)].

Generator `G` has the following 32-byte encoding:

    G = 0x5866666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666666

**Secondary generator point** (`J`) is the elliptic curve point defined as decoded hash of the primary generator `G`:

    J = 8·Decode(SHA3-256(Encode(G)))

Generator `J` has the following 32-byte encoding:

    J = 0x00c774b875ed4e395ebb0782b4d93db838d3c4c0840bc970570517555ca71b77

**Tertiary generator points** (`G[i]`) are 31 elliptic curve points defined as decoded hash of the primary generator `G`:

    G[i] = 8·Decode(SHA3-256(byte(i) || Encode(G) || int64le(cnt[i])))

Counter `cnt[i]` is chosen to be the smallest positive integer starting with 0 that yields a valid edwards25519 point for a given index `i`.

### Hash functions

#### Hash256

`Hash256` is a secure hash function that takes a variable-length binary string `x` as input and outputs a 256-bit string.

    Hash256(x) = SHAKE128("ChainCA-256" || x, 32)

#### StreamHash

`StreamHash` is a secure extendable-output hash function that takes a variable-length binary string `x` as input
and outputs a variable-length hash string depending on a number of bytes (`n`) requested.

    StreamHash(x, n) = SHAKE128("ChainCA-stream" || x, n)

#### ScalarHash

`ScalarHash` is a secure hash function that takes a variable-length binary string `x` as input and outputs a [scalar](#scalar):

1. For the input string `x` compute a 512-bit hash `h`:

        h = SHAKE128("ChainCA-scalar" || x, 64)

2. Interpret `h` as a little-endian integer and reduce modulo subgroup [order](#elliptic-curve) `L`:

        s = h mod L

3. Return the resulting scalar `s`.


### Ring Signature

Ring signature is a variable-length string representing a signature of knowledge of a one private key among an ordered set of public keys (specified separately). In other words, ring signature implements an OR function of the public keys: “I know the private key for A, or B or C”. Ring signatures are used in [asset range proofs](#asset-range-proof).

The ring signature is encoded as a string of `n+1` 32-byte elements where `n` is the number of public keys provided separately (typically stored or imputed from the data structure containing the ring signature):

    {e, s[0], s[1], ..., s[n-1]}

Each 32-byte element is an integer coded using little endian convention. I.e., a 32-byte string `x` `x[0],...,x[31]` represents the integer `x[0] + 2^8 · x[1] + ... + 2^248 · x[31]`.

Ring signature described below supports proving knowledge of multiple discrete logarithms at once.

#### Create Ring Signature

**Inputs:**

1. `msg`: the string to be signed.
2. `M`: number of discrete logarithms to prove per signature (1 for normal signature, 2 for dlog equality proof).
3. `{B[u]}`: `M` base [points](#point) to validate the signature.
4. `{P[i,u]}`: `n·M` [points](#point) representing the public keys.
5. `j`: the index of the designated public key, so that `P[j] == p·B`.
6. `p`: the secret [scalar](#scalar) representing a private key for the public keys `P[u,j]`.

**Output:** `{e0, s[0], ..., s[n-1]}`: the ring signature, `n+1` 32-byte elements.

**Algorithm:**

1. Let `counter = 0`.
2. Let the `msghash` be a hash of the input non-secret data: `msghash = Hash256("RS" || byte(48+M) || B || P[0] || ... || P[n-1] || msg)`.
3. Calculate a sequence of: `n-1` 32-byte random values, 64-byte `nonce` and 1-byte `mask`: `{r[i], nonce, mask} = StreamHash(uint64le(counter) || msghash || p || uint64le(j), 32·(n-1) + 64 + 1)`, where:
    * `counter` is encoded as a 64-bit little-endian integer,
    * `p` is encoded as a 256-bit little-endian integer,
    * `j` is encoded as a 64-bit little-endian integer.
4. Calculate `k = nonce mod L`, where `nonce` is interpreted as a 64-byte little-endian integer and reduced modulo subgroup order `L`.
5. Calculate the initial e-value, let `i = j+1 mod n`:
    1. For each `u` from 0 to `M-1`: calculate `R[u,i]` as the [point](#point) `k·B[u]`.
    2. Define `w[j]` as `mask` with lower 4 bits set to zero: `w[j] = mask & 0xf0`.
    3. Calculate `e[i] = ScalarHash("e" || R[0,i] || ... || R[M-1,i] || msghash || uint64le(i) || w[j])` where `i` is encoded as a 64-bit little-endian integer.
6. For `step` from `1` to `n-1` (these steps are skipped if `n` equals 1):
    1. Let `i = (j + step) mod n`.
    2. Calculate the forged s-value `s[i] = r[step-1]`.
    3. Define `z[i]` as `s[i]` with the most significant 4 bits set to zero.
    4. Define `w[i]` as a most significant byte of `s[i]` with lower 4 bits set to zero: `w[i] = s[i][31] & 0xf0`.
    5. Let `i’ = i+1 mod n`.
    6. For each `u` from 0 to `M-1`:
        1. Calculate point `R[u,i’] = z[i]·B[u] - e[i]·P[i,u]`.
    7. Calculate `e[i’] = ScalarHash("e" || R[0,i’] || ... || R[M-1,i’] || msghash || uint64le(i’) || w[i])` where `i’` is encoded as a 64-bit little-endian integer.
7. Calculate the non-forged `z[j] = k + p·e[j] mod L` and encode it as a 32-byte little-endian integer.
8. If `z[j]` is greater than 2<sup>252</sup>–1, then increment the `counter` and try again from the beginning. The chance of this happening is below 1 in 2<sup>124</sup>.
9. Define `s[j]` as `z[j]` with 4 high bits set to high 4 bits of the `mask`.
10. Return the ring signature `{e[0], s[0], ..., s[n-1]}`, total `n+1` 32-byte elements.


#### Validate Ring Signature

**Inputs:**

1. `msg`: the string being signed.
2. `M`: number of discrete logarithms to prove per signature (1 for normal signature, 2 for dlog equality proof).
3. `{B[u]}`: `M` base [points](#point) to validate the signature.
4. `{P[i,u]}`: `n·M` [points](#point) representing the public keys.
5. `e[0], s[0], ... s[n-1]`: ring signature consisting of `n+1` 32-byte elements.


**Output:** `true` if the verification succeeded, `false` otherwise.

**Algorithm:**

1. Let the `msghash` be a hash of the input non-secret data: `msghash = Hash256("RS" || byte(48+M) || B || P[0] || ... || P[n-1] || msg)`.
2. For each `i` from `0` to `n-1`:
    1. Define `z[i]` as `s[i]` with the most significant 4 bits set to zero (see note below).
    2. Define `w[i]` as a most significant byte of `s[i]` with lower 4 bits set to zero: `w[i] = s[i][31] & 0xf0`.
    3. For each `u` from 0 to `M-1`:
        1. Calculate point `R[u,i+1] = z[i]·B[u] - e[i]·P[u,i]`.
    4. Calculate `e[i+1] = ScalarHash("e" || R[0,i+1] || ... || R[M-1,i+1] || msghash || i+1 || w[i])` where `i+1` is encoded as a 64-bit little-endian integer.
3. Return true if `e[0]` equals `e[n]`, otherwise return false.

Note: when the s-values are decoded as little-endian integers we must set their 4 most significant bits to zero in order to restore the original scalar as produced while [creating the range proof](#create-asset-range-proof). During signing the non-forged s-value has its 4 most significant bits set to random bits to make it indistinguishable from the forged s-values.





### Borromean Ring Signature

Borromean ring signature ([Maxwell2015](https://github.com/Blockstream/borromean_paper)) is a data structure representing several [ring signatures](#ring-signature) compactly joined with an AND function of the ring signatures: “I know the private key for (A or B) and (C or D)”. Borromean ring signatures are used in [value range proofs](#value-range-proof) that prove the range of multiple digits at once.

The borromean ring signature is encoded as a sequence of 32-byte elements.

    {e, s[i,j]...}

Where:

* `i` is in range `0..n` where `n` is the number of rings.
* `j` is in range `0..m` where `m` is the number of signatures per ring.

Example: a [value range proof](#value-range-proof) for a 4-bit mantissa has 9 elements in its borromean ring signature:

    {
      e,
      s[0,0], s[0,1], s[0,2], s[0,3], # base-4 digit at position 0 (proof for the lower two bits)
      s[1,0], s[1,1], s[1,2], s[1,3], # base-4 digit at position 1 (proof for the higher two bits)
    }

#### Create Borromean Ring Signature

**Inputs:**

1. `msg`: the string to be signed.
2. `n`: number of rings.
3. `m`: number of signatures in each ring.

5. `{B[i,u]}`: `n·M` base [points](#point) to validate the signature.
6. `{P[i,j,u]}`: `n·m·M` [points](#point) representing public keys.
7. `{p[i]}`: the list of `n` [scalars](#scalar) representing private keys.

    * `counter` is encoded as a 64-bit little-endian integer,

## Keys

### Extended Key Pair

*Extended key pair* (EKP) is a pair of [ChainKD](chainkd.md) extended public keys (xpubs):

    {xpub1, xpub2}

EKP is encoded as a 128-byte concatenation of the corresponding extended public keys (64 bytes each):

    EKP = xpub1 || xpub2

EKPs allows “two-dimensional” key derivation by deriving from one key and leaving the other one unchanged, therefore allowing “vertical” derivation from [Record Encryption Keys](#record-encryption-key) to [Intermediate Encryption Keys](#intermediate-encryption-key), [Asset ID Encryption Keys](#asset-id-encryption-key) and [Value Encryption Keys](#value-encryption-key) and “horizontal” derivation from a root key pair associated with a user’s account to per-transaction and per-output key pairs.

Note that EKPs use extended _public_ keys to enable selective “read access” to authorized parties by sharing keys in certain points in the hierarchy, not to actually make them widely public.


### Record Encryption Key

Record encryption key (REK or `rek`) is an [extended key pair](#extended-key-pair):

    REK = {xpub1, xpub2}

It is used to decrypt the payload data from the [value range proof](#value-range-proof), and derive [asset ID encryption key](#asset-id-encryption-key) and [value encryption key](#value-encryption-key).

The first `xpub1` is used to derive more specific keys as described below that all share the same second key `xpub2`.
The second `xpub2` is used to derive the entire hierarchies of encryption keys, so that a [REK](#record-encryption-key), or [IEK](#intermediate-encryption-key) could be shared for the entire account instead of per-transaction.


### Intermediate Encryption Key

Intermediate encryption key (IEK or `iek`) is an [extended key pair](#extended-key-pair) that allows decrypting the asset ID and the value in the output commitment. It is derived from the [record encryption key](#record-encryption-key) as follows:

    IEK = {ND(REK.xpub1, "IEK"), REK.xpub2}

where `ND` is non-hardened derivation as defined by [ChainKD](chainkd.md#derive-non-hardened-extended-public-key).


### Asset ID Encryption Key

Asset ID encryption key (AEK or `aek`) is an [extended key pair](#extended-key-pair) that allows decrypting the asset ID in the output commitment. It is derived from the [intermediate encryption key](#intermediate-encryption-key) as follows:

    AEK = {ND(IEK.xpub1, "AEK"), IEK.xpub2}

where `ND` is non-hardened derivation as defined by [ChainKD](chainkd.md#derive-non-hardened-extended-public-key).


### Value Encryption Key

Value encryption key (VEK or `vek`) is an [extended key pair](#extended-key-pair) that allows decrypting the amount in the output commitment. It is derived from the [intermediate encryption key](#intermediate-encryption-key) as follows:

    VEK = {ND(IEK.xpub1, "VEK"), IEK.xpub2}

where `ND` is non-hardened derivation as defined by [ChainKD](chainkd.md#derive-non-hardened-extended-public-key).


### Asset ID Blinding Factor

A [scalar](#scalar) `c` used to produce a blinded asset ID commitment out of a [cleartext asset ID commitment](#asset-id-commitment):

    AC = (A + c·G, c·J)

The asset ID blinding factor is created by [Create Blinded Asset ID Commitment](#create-blinded-asset-id-commitment).


### Value Blinding Factor

An [scalar](#scalar) `f` used to produce a [value commitment](#value-commitment) out of the [asset ID commitment](#asset-id-commitment) `(H, Ba)`:

    VC = (value·H + f·G, value·Ba + f·J)

The value blinding factors are created by [Create Blinded Value Commitment](#create-blinded-value-commitment) algorithm.


### Transient Issuance Key

Transient issuance key is created for the [confidential issuance proof](#issuance-asset-range-proof) when there is no pre-defined issuance key.

**Inputs:**

1. `assetid`: asset ID for which the issuance key is being generated.
2. `aek`: [asset ID encryption key](#asset-id-encryption-key).

**Output:** `(y,Y)`: a pair of private and public keys.

**Algorithm:**

1. Calculate scalar `y = ScalarHash("IARP.y" || assetid || aek)`.
2. Calculate point `Y` by multiplying base point by `y`: `Y = y·G`.
3. Return key pair `(y,Y)`.





## Commitments

### Asset ID Point

_Asset ID point_ is a [point](#point) representing an asset ID.

It is defined as follows:

1. Let `counter = 0`.
2. Calculate `Hash256("AssetID" || assetID || uint64le(counter))` where `counter` is encoded as a 64-bit unsigned integer using little-endian convention.
3. Decode the resulting hash as a [point](#point) `P` on the elliptic curve.
4. If the point is invalid, increment `counter` and go back to step 2. This will happen on average for half of the asset IDs.
5. Calculate point `A = 8·P` (8 is a cofactor in edwards25519) which belongs to a subgroup [order](#elliptic-curve) `L`.
6. Return `A`.

#### Denial of service risks

Since the amount of computations it takes to compute an Asset ID point is variable, malicious prover may find an `assetID` by brute force that would require the verifier to perform arbitrary amount of computations.

However, mounting an attack to force a non-negligible amount of work on a verifier is computationally infeasible. For `N` hash computations to be performed by a verifier, a malicious prover would have to perform an order of `2^N` hash computations.

The alternative solution is to have creators of asset identifiers to choose an issuance program (that defines the asset ID) so that their asset ID always hashes to a valid point. Unfortunately, this approach rejects roughly half of existing asset IDs created on the blockchains deployed before the extension to _Confidential Assets_. We consider that to preserve asset ID compatibility at the risk of an infeasible denial of service attack is an acceptable tradeoff.


### Asset ID Commitment

An asset ID commitment `AC` is an ElGamal commitment represented by a [point pair](#point-pair):

    AC = (H, Ba)

    Ba = c·J

### Value Commitment

A value commitment `VC` is an ElGamal commitment represented by a [point pair](#point-pair):

    VC = (V, Bv)

    V  = v·H  + f·G
    Bv = v·Ba + f·J

where:

## Proofs


### Asset Range Proof

The asset range proof demonstrates that a given [asset ID commitment](#asset-id-commitment) commits to one of the asset IDs specified in the transaction inputs. A [whole-transaction validation procedure](#validate-assets-flow) makes sure that all of the declared asset ID commitments in fact belong to the transaction inputs.

Asset range proof can be [non-confidential](#non-confidential-asset-range-proof) or [confidential](#confidential-asset-range-proof).

#### Confidential Asset Range Proof

Field                        | Type      | Description
-----------------------------|-----------|------------------
Type                         | byte      | Contains value 0x01 to indicate the commitment is blinded.

#### Create Asset Range Proof

**Inputs:**

1. `AC’`: the output [asset ID commitment](#asset-id-commitment) for which the range proof is being created.
2. `{AC[i]}`: `n` candidate [asset ID commitments](#asset-id-commitment).

4. `c’`: the [blinding factor](#asset-id-blinding-factor) for the commitment `AC’`.
5. `c`: the [blinding factor](#asset-id-blinding-factor) for the candidate commitment `AC[j]`.
6. `message`: a variable-length string.

**Output:** an [asset range proof](#asset-range-proof) consisting of a list of input asset ID commitments and a ring signature.

**Algorithm:**

1. Calculate the message hash to sign:

        msghash = Hash256("ARP" || AC’ || AC[0] || ... || AC[n-1] || message)

2. Calculate the set of public keys for the ring signature from the set of input asset ID commitments:

            Q[i] = AC’.Ba - AC[i].Ba

    3. [Validate the ring signature](#validate-ring-signature) `e[0], s[0], ... s[n-1]` with `msg`, [generators](#generators) `(G,J)` and `{(P[i],Q[i])}`.
3. Return true if verification was successful, and false otherwise.





### Issuance Asset Range Proof

The issuance asset range proof demonstrates that a given [confidential issuance](#confidential-issuance) commits to one of the asset IDs specified in the transaction inputs. It contains a ring signature. The other inputs to the [validation procedure](#validate-issuance-asset-range-proof) are computed from other elements in the confidential issuance witness, as part of the [issuance validation procedure](blockchain.md#issuance-2-validation).

The size of the ring signature (`n+1` 32-byte elements) and the number of issuance keys (`n`) are derived from `n` [asset issuance choices](blockchain.md#asset-issuance-choice) specified outside the range proof.

The proof also contains a _tracing point_ that that lets any issuer to prove or disprove whether the issuance is performed by their issuance key.

TBD: modify the confidential proof to allow "watch keys" (will require change of `{Y}` to `{(Y,W)}` and a pair of tracing points).


#### Create Issuance Asset Range Proof

When creating a confidential issuance, the first step is to construct the rest of the input commitment and input witness, including an asset issuance choice for each asset that one wants to include in the anonymity set. The issuance key for each asset should be extracted from the [issuance programs](blockchain.md#program). (Issuance programs that support confidential issuance should have a branch that checks use of the correct issuance key using `ISSUANCEKEY` instruction.)

5. `message`: a variable-length string,
6. `nonce`: unique 32-byte [string](blockchain.md#string) that makes the tracing point unique,
7. `j`: the index of the asset being issued (such that `AC.H == A[j] + c·G`).
8. `y`: the private key for the issuance key corresponding to the asset being issued: `Y[j] = y·G`.

### Value Range Proof

Value range proof demonstrates that a [value commitment](#value-commitment) encodes a value between 0 and 2<sup>63</sup>–1. The 63-bit limit is chosen for consistency with the numeric limits defined for the asset version 1 outputs and VM version 1 [numbers](vm1.md#vm-number).

Value range proof can be [non-confidential](#non-confidential-value-range-proof) or [confidential](#confidential-value-range-proof).

#### Non-Confidential Value Range Proof

A non-confidential range proof demonstrates the non-encrypted amount and allows efficient verification that a given [value commitment](#value-commitment) commits to that amount.

Field                        | Type      | Description
-----------------------------|-----------|------------------
Type                         | byte      | Contains value 0x00 to indicate the commitment is not blinded.
Amount                       | varint63  | Amount

#### Confidential Value Range Proof

A confidential range proof proves that a given [value commitment](#value-commitment) commits to an amount in a valid range (between 0 and 2<sup>63</sup>–1) without revealing the exact value.

For the most compact encoding, confidential value range proof uses base-4 digits represented by 4-key ring signatures proving the value of each pair of bits. If the number of bits is odd, the last ring signature contains only 2 elements proving the value of the highest-order bit. All ring signatures share the same e-value (see below) forming a so-called "[borromean ring signature](#borromean-ring-signature)".

Value range proof allows a space-privacy tradeoff by making a smaller number of bits confidential while exposing a "minimum value" and a decimal exponent. The complete value is broken down in the following components:

    value = vmin + (10^exp)·(d[0]·(4^0) + ... + d[m-1]·(4^(m-1)))

Where d<sub>i</sub> is the i’th digit in a m-digit mantissa (that has either 2·m–1 or 2·m bits). Exponent `exp` and the minimum value `vmin` are public and by default set to zero by the user creating the transaction.

Field                     | Type      | Description
--------------------------|-----------|------------------
Type                      | byte      | Contains value 0x01 to indicate the commitment is blinded.
Number of bits            | byte      | Integer `n` indicating number of confidential mantissa bits between 1 and 63.
Exponent                  | byte      | Integer `exp` indicating the decimal exponent from 0 to 10.
Minimum value             | varint63  | Minimum value `vmin` from 0 to 2<sup>63</sup>–1.
Digit commitments         | [pubkey]  | List of `(n+1)/2 – 1` individual digit pedersen commitments where `n` is the number of mantissa bits.
Borromean Ring Signature  | [Borromean Ring Signature](#borromean-ring-signature) | List of all 32-byte elements comprising all ring signatures proving the value of each digit.

The total number of elements in the [Borromean Ring Signature](#borromean-ring-signature) is `1 + 4·n/2` where `n` is number of bits and `n/2` is a number of rings.

**Algorithm:**

1. Expand the encryption key: `ek = StreamHash("EV" || vek || VC, 40)`.
2. Decrypt the value using the first 8 bytes: `value = ev XOR ek[0,8]`.
3. Decrypt the value blinding factor using the last 32 bytes: `f = ef XOR ek[8,32]` where `f` is encoded as 256-bit little-endian integer.
4. [Create blinded value commitment](#create-blinded-value-commitment) `VC’` using `AC`, `value` and the raw blinding factor `f` (instead of `vek`).
5. Verify that `VC’` equals `VC`. If not, halt and return `nil`.
6. Return `(value, f)`.


### Encrypted Asset ID

Encrypted value is a 64-byte string representing a simple encryption of the [asset ID](blockchain.md#asset-id) and its blinding factor as used in a [asset ID commitment](#asset-id-commitment). The encrypted asset ID is authenticated by the corresponding _asset ID commitment_.

#### Encrypt Asset ID

**Inputs:**

1. `assetID`: the [asset ID](blockchain.md#asset-id).
2. `AC`: the [asset ID commitment](#asset-id-commitment) hiding the `assetID`.

### Encrypt Output

This algorithm encrypts the amount and asset ID of a given output and creates [value range proof](#value-range-proof) with encrypted payload.
If the excess factor is provided, it is used to compute a matching blinding factor to cancel it out.

This algorithm _does not_ create [asset range proof](#asset-range-proof) (ARP), since it requires knowledge about the input descriptors and one of their blinding factors.

ARP can be added separately using [Create Asset Range Proof](#create-asset-range-proof).

**Inputs:**

1. `rek`: the [record encryption key](#record-encryption-key).
2. `assetID`: the output asset ID.
3. `value`: the output amount.
4. `N`: number of bits to encrypt (`value` must fit within `N` bits).
5. `plaintext`: binary string that has length of less than `32·(2·N-1)` bytes when encoded as [varstring31](blockchain.md#string).
6. Optional `q`: the [excess factor](#excess-factor) to have this output balance with the transaction. If omitted, blinding factor is generated at random.

**Outputs:**

1. `AC`: the [asset ID commitment](#asset-id-commitment).
2. `VC`: the [value commitment](#value-commitment).
3. `VRP`: the [value range proof](#value-range-proof).
4. `c’`: the output [asset ID blinding factor](#asset-id-blinding-factor) for the asset ID commitment `H’`.
5. `f’`: the output [value blinding factor](#value-blinding-factor).

In case of failure, returns `nil` instead of the items listed above.

**Algorithm:**

1. Encode `plaintext` using [varstring31](blockchain.md#string) encoding and split the string in 32-byte chunks `{pt[i]}` (last chunk padded with zero bytes if needed).
2. If the number of chunks `{pt[i]}` exceeds `2·N-1`, halt and return `nil`.
3. If the number of chunks `{pt[i]}` is less than `2·N-1`, pad the array with all-zero 32-byte chunks.
4. If `value ≥ 2^N`, halt and return `nil`.
5. [Derive asset ID encryption key](#asset-id-encryption-key) `aek` from `rek`.
6. [Derive value encryption key](#value-encryption-key) `vek` from `rek`.
7. [Create blinded asset ID commitment](#create-blinded-asset-id-commitment): compute `(AC,c)` from `(assetID, aek)`.
9. [Create blinded value commitment](#create-blinded-value-commitment): compute `(V,f)` from `(vek, value, AC.H)`.
10. If `q` is provided:
    1. Compute `extra` scalar: `extra = q - f - value·c`.
    2. Add `extra` to the value blinding factor: `f = f + extra`.
    3. Adjust the value commitment too: `VC = VC + extra·(G,J)`.
    4. Note: as a result, the total blinding factor of the output will be equal to `q`.
11. [Create Value Range Proof](#create-value-range-proof): compute `VRP` from `(AC, VC, N, value, {pt[i]}, f, rek)`.
12. Return `(AC, VC, VRP, c, f)`.
