## Introduction

This is a simple deterministic key derivation scheme useful for digital signatures and Diffie-Hellman key exchange.

Features:

1. Scheme is fully deterministic and allows producing complex hierarchies of keys from a single high-entropy seed.
2. Derive private keys from extended private keys using “hardened derivation”.
3. Derive public keys independently from private keys using “non-hardened derivation”.
4. Hardened and non-hardened public keys and signatures are compatible with [EdDSA](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032) specification. Specifically, private keys are 64-byte raw secret keys used in [NaCl](https://nacl.cr.yp.to/sign.html) function `crypto_sign`.
5. Variable-length string selectors instead of fixed-length integer indexes.
6. Short 64-byte extended public and private keys without special encoding.
7. No metadata: an extended key carries only an additional 32-byte salt to avoid having the derivation function depend only on the key itself.
8. Privacy: extended key does not reveal neither its place in the hierarchy, nor the manner of derivation (hardened or non-hardened).

Limitations:

1. Depth of non-hardened derivation is limited to 2<sup>20</sup>.
2. Number of distinct root keys or hardened public keys is 2<sup>250</sup>, half of the keyspace allowed in EdDSA.
3. Number of distinct non-hardened public keys is 2<sup>230</sup> (reduced to keep compatibility with ECDH use and allow a comfortably large number of derivation levels).
4. Entropy of the nonce for any derived key is at least 2<sup>250</sup> which is 4 times lower than nonce in EdDSA.


## Definitions

**Hash(X,N)** is SHAKE-128 as specified in [FIPS 202](http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.202.pdf) with input string `X` and output length `N` in bytes.

**Selector** is a variable-length byte string that can be used as a derivation index.

**Secret scalar** is 32-byte string representing a 256-bit integer using little-endian convention.

**Extended private key** (aka “xprv”) is a 64-byte string representing a key that can be used for deriving *child extended private and public keys*.

**Extended public key** (aka “xpub”) is a 64-byte string representing a key that can be used for deriving *child extended public keys*.

**EdDSA secret key** (aka “sk”) is a 64-byte string representing a raw secret key used for creating EdDSA signatures (consists of 32-byte scalar and 32-byte “prefix”).

**EdDSA public key** (aka “pk”) is a 32-byte string representing encoding of an elliptic curve point on Ed25519 as defined in EdDSA ([RFC 8032](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032)).


## Algorithms

### Generate root key

    2. the highest bit of the last byte is cleared, 
    3. the second highest bit of the last byte is set.
2. Interpret the buffer as the little-endian integer, forming a secret scalar `s`.

1. First encode the y coordinate (in the range 0 <= y < p) as a little-endian string of 32 bytes. The most significant bit of the final byte is always zero.
2. To form the encoding of the point `P`, copy the least significant bit of the x coordinate to the most significant bit of the final byte. 
3. Return the resulting 32-byte string as `pubkey`.


## FAQ

**Can I derive hardened keys from non-hardened ones?**

Yes. The derivation method only affects relationship between the key and its parent, but does not affect how other keys are derived from that key.
Note that secrecy of all derived private keys (both hardened and non-hardened, at all levels) from a non-hardened key depends on keeping either the parent extended public key secret, or all non-hardened sibling keys secret.

**Is it safe to derive secret key from the scalar instead of raw 256 bits of entropy?**

EdDSA defines private key as raw 256 bits of entropy that are expanded using a hash function to a 512 bits: half of them are pruned to form a secret scalar that defines public key, another half is used to generate the nonce for the Schnorr signature. Unfortunately, 

We believe the scheme is equivalent to RFC6979 that derives the nonce by hashing the secret scalar. As an extra safety measure, the secret scalar is concatenated with the `salt` (which is not considered secret in this scheme) in order to make derivation function not dependent solely on the key.

**Why this scheme uses variable-length selectors instead of 31-bit indices as in BIP32?**

In our experience index-based derivation is not always convenient and can be extended to longer selectors only through additional derivation levels which is less efficient (e.g. 128-bit selectors would require 5 scalar multiplications in BIP32). However, users are free to use integer selectors by simply encoding them as 32-bit or 64-bit integers and passing to ChainKD. If you need to mix integer- and string-based indexing, you could prepend a type byte or use a standard encoding such as [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) or [JSON](http://www.json.org).


## Security

### Capabilities

Knowledge of the seed or the root extended private key:

1. Allows deriving hardened extended private key.
2. Allows deriving non-hardened extended private key.
3. Allows signing messages with the root key.

Knowledge of an extended private key:

1. Allows deriving hardened extended private key.
2. Allows deriving non-hardened extended private key.
3. Allows signing messages with that key.

Knowledge of an extended public key:

1. Allows deriving non-hardened public keys.
2. Does not allow determining if it is derived in a hardened or non-hardened way.
3. Does not allow determining if another extended public key is a sibling of the key.
4. Does not allow signing
5. Does not allow deriving private keys.
6. Does not allow deriving hardened public keys.

Knowledge of a parent extended public key and one of non-hardened derived extended private keys:

1. Allows extracting parent private key: `s = (s’ - f) mod L` where `f` is derived from the parent `xpub` and `s’` is extracted from the child `xprv’`.

### Root key security

We set 6 bits in the secret 256 bits of a 512-bit root extended key. Therefore, the root key requires an order of 2<sup>250</sup> attempts by brute-force.

### Hardened derivation security

Private keys derived using hardened derivation have 6 bits set. Therefore, the extended private key requires an order of 2<sup>250</sup> attempts by brute-force.

### Child key collisions

TBD: collisions require order of 2<sup>115</sup> derived keys

TBD: High bits as per EdDSA

TBD: Hardened derivation resets depth limit

TBD:
