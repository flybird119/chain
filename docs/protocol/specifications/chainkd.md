## Introduction

**ChainKD** is a deterministic key derivation scheme. Generated keys are compatible with EdDSA signature scheme and Diffie-Hellman key exchange.

Features:

1. Scheme is fully deterministic and allows producing complex hierarchies of keys from a single high-entropy seed.
2. Derive private keys from extended private keys using “hardened derivation”.
3. Derive public keys independently from private keys using “non-hardened derivation”.
4. Hardened and non-hardened public keys and signatures are compatible with [EdDSA](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032) specification. Signing keys are 64-byte strings, the format used in [NaCl](https://nacl.cr.yp.to/sign.html) function `crypto_sign`.
5. Variable-length string selectors instead of fixed-length 31-bit integer indices.
6. Short 64-byte extended public and private keys without special encoding.
7. No metadata: an extended key carries only an additional 32-byte salt that allows sharing public key without revealing child public keys.
8. Privacy: extended key does not reveal neither its place in the hierarchy, nor the manner of derivation (hardened or non-hardened).

Limitations:

1. Depth of non-hardened derivation is limited to 2<sup>20</sup> (more than million levels).
2. Number of distinct root keys or hardened public keys is 2<sup>250</sup>, half of the keyspace allowed in EdDSA.
3. Number of distinct non-hardened public keys is 2<sup>230</sup>.


## Definitions

**Selector** is a variable-length byte string indexing a child key during key derivation.

**Secret scalar** is 32-byte string representing a 256-bit integer using little-endian convention.

**Extended private key** (aka “xprv”) is a 64-byte string representing a key that can be used for deriving *child extended private and public keys*.

**Extended public key** (aka “xpub”) is a 64-byte string representing a key that can be used for deriving *child extended public keys*.

**Derivation key** (aka “dk”) is the second half (32-byte string) of the extended private or public key that enables derivation of the child keys or proving linkability of the keys.

**Signing key** (aka “sk”) is a 64-byte string representing a raw signing key used for creating EdDSA signatures (consists of 32-byte scalar and 32-byte “prefix”). This is the format used by `crypto_sign` function in [NaCl](https://nacl.cr.yp.to/sign.html) library.

**Private key** is a the first half of the _signing key_ representing a raw signing scalar usable for ECDH and generating a _public key_.

**Public key** (aka “pk”) is a 32-byte string representing encoding of an elliptic curve point on Ed25519 as defined in EdDSA ([RFC 8032](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8032)).


## Algorithms

### Generate root key

**Input:** `seed`, a seed byte sequence (variable-length, should contain at least 256 bits of entropy).

**Output:** `xprv`, a root extended private key.

1. Compute 64-byte string `xprv = HMAC-SHA512(key: "Root", data: seed)`.
2. Prune the first 32 bytes of `xprv` to produce a valid scalar:
    1. the lowest 3 bits of the first byte are cleared,
    2. the highest bit of the last byte is cleared,
    3. the second highest bit of the last byte is set,
    4. the third highest bit of the last byte is cleared.
3. Return `xprv`.


### Generate extended public key

**Input:** `xprv`, an extended private key.

**Output:** `xpub`, an extended public key.

1. Split `xprv` in two halves: 32-byte scalar `s` and 32-byte derivation key `dk`.
2. Perform a fixed-base scalar multiplication `P = s·B` where `B` is a base point of Ed25519.
3. [Encode](#encode-public-key) point `P` as `pubkey`.
4. Return extended public key `xpub = pubkey || dk` (64 bytes).

2. Compute `xprv’ = HMAC-SHA512(key: dk, data: "H" || s || selector)`.
3. Prune the first 32 bytes of `xprv’` to produce a valid scalar:
    1. the lowest 3 bits of the first byte are cleared,
    2. the highest bit of the last byte is cleared,
    3. the second highest bit of the last byte is set,
    4. the third highest bit of the last byte is cleared.
4. Return `xprv’`.


### Derive non-hardened extended private key

**Inputs:**

**Output:** `xprv’`, the derived extended public key.

1. [Generate extended public key](#generate-extended-public-key) `xpub` for a given `xprv`.
2. Split `xpub` in two halves: 32-byte pubkey `P` and 32-byte derivation key `dk`.
3. Compute `F = HMAC-SHA512(key: dk, data: "N" || P || selector)`.
4. Split `F` in two halves: a 32-byte `fbuffer` and a 32-byte `dk’`.
5. Clear lowest 3 bits and highest 23 bits of `fbuffer` and interpret it as a scalar `f` using little-endian notation.
6. Compute derived secret scalar `s’ = s + f` (without reducing the result modulo the subgroup order).
7. Let `privkey’` be a 32-byte string encoding scalar `s’` using little-endian convention.
8. Return `xprv’ = privkey’ || dk’`.


### Derive non-hardened extended public key

### Encode public key

**Input:** `P`, a Ed25519 curve point.

**Output:** `pubkey`, a 32-byte string representing a point on Ed25519 curve.

1. First encode the y coordinate (in the range 0 <= y < p) as a little-endian string of 32 bytes. The most significant bit of the final byte is always zero.
2. To form the encoding of the point `P`, copy the least significant bit of the x coordinate to the most significant bit of the final byte.
3. Return the resulting 32-byte string as `pubkey`.


## Design rationale

### Names

**ChainKD** stands for “Chain Key Derivation”.

**Xpub** and **xprv** are terms adoped from the [BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki)
scheme where public and private keys are _extended_ with additional entropy (“derivation key”)

**Derivation key** or **dk** is an additional 32-byte code stored within _xpub_ and _xprv_
that allows deriving child keys and proving linkage between any pair of child keys.
In BIP32 that code is called “chain code”. We chose not to reuse the term of BIP32 in order
to make it more explicit that the derivation key is _semi-private_.

### Deriving hardened keys from non-hardened ones

The derivation method only affects relationship between the key and its parent,
but does not affect how other keys are derived from that key.
Note that secrecy of all derived private keys (both hardened and non-hardened, 
at all levels) from a non-hardened key depends on keeping either the parent 
extended public key secret, or all non-hardened sibling keys secret.

### Variable-length selectors instead of integers

[BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki) uses
31-bit indices for derivation. ChainKD generalizes indices to arbitrary-length 
binary strings called “selectors”.

In our experience index-based derivation is not always convenient and can be 
extended to longer selectors only through additional derivation levels which 
is less efficient (e.g. 128-bit selectors would require 5 scalar multiplications 
in BIP32). However, users are free to use integer selectors by simply encoding 
them as 32-bit or 64-bit integers and passing to ChainKD. If you need to mix 
integer- and string-based indexing, you could prepend a type byte or use a standard 
encoding such as [Protocol Buffers](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/) 
or [JSON](http://www.json.org).

### Torsion point safety and compatibility

Edwards curve 25519 allows small subgroup attacks when secret scalars are used for 
Diffie-Hellman key exchange. To prevent leaking a few bits of the scalar, the Curve25519
protocol and later EdDSA protocol require that the secret scalar is pre-multiplied by 8.
That way, when the scalar is multiplied by a torsion point, the result is always point at infinity
which leaks no information about the scalar.

Alternative mechanism to provide safety against small subgroup attacks is using
a _torsion-safe representative_ of a scalar: transformation `t(s)` that keeps 
public key unmodified: `t(s)·B == s·B` while multiplication by a torsion point 
always yields point at infinity: `t(s)·T == O`. In other words, `t(s) == s mod l` 
and `t(s) == 0 mod 8`.

That transformation was [proposed](https://moderncrypto.org/mail-archive/curves/2017/000866.html) 
by Henry de Valence, Ian Goldberg, George Kadianakis and Isis Lovecruft on the “Curves” mailing list
together with efficient time-constant implementation based on precomputed table of 8 scalars.

The torsion-safe representative is indispensable when the keys are being blinded via multiplication 
(such as in key blinding scheme in [Tor proposal 224](https://gitweb.torproject.org/torspec.git/tree/proposals/224-rend-spec-ng.txt#n1979)).

Unfortunately, torsion-safe representation and blinding by multiplication affect
the lower and higher bits  that are statically defined by Curve25519 and EdDSA: 
3 lower bits must be zero and the highest bits must be 1 and 0 (assuming scalar
is a 32-byte little-endian integer). Software that implements Montgomery ladder 
or scalar multiplication may make assumptions about the value of these bits, 
placing constraints on the schemes doing linear operation on the keys.

As a result, to maintain compatibility with EdDSA requirements, ChainKD uses
the trick described in [BIP32-Ed25519](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByMtMw2hul0EMFJuNnZORDR2NDA):
child keys are blinded via addition of a base point multiple instead of 
multiplying the parent key (like in BIP32), and the magnitute of the child scalar
is computed to be a multiple of cofactor (8) and several bits smaller in order 
to not affect the two highest bits even after deriving many levels deep.

As a result, for all derived keys, low 3 bits remain zero and high 2 bits are
set to 1 and 0 as required by EdDSA, but at the cost of a hard limit 
on the derivation depth and a slightly increased (yet negligible) chance
of child key collisions.

Using derivation via addition of a blinding factor (`s’ = s + f` instead of `s’ = s·f`)
also provides better performance: scalars are faster to add than multiply, and
multiplying the factor `f` by a fixed base point can be made significantly faster
than scalar multiplication by an arbitrary point.

### Signing compatibility

EdDSA defines the private key as a 32-byte random string. The signing procedure then expands 
that private key into a 64-byte hash, where first half is pruned to be a valid scalar, and the 
second half is used as a “prefix” to be mixed with the message to generate a secret nonce.

Unfortunately, such definition of a private key is not compatible with linear operations
required for _non-hardened_ derivation. Which means, that no key derivation scheme that
needs independent key derivation for secret and public keys, is able produce private keys
fully compatible with EdDSA definition of the signing algorithm.

However, [NaCl library](http://nacl.cr.yp.to/sign.html) happens to decouple most of the 
signing logic from the key representation and uses that 64-byte hash as its “secret key”
representation for the `sign` function that we call an “expanded private key”.

ChainKD and authors of [BIP32-Ed25519](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByMtMw2hul0EMFJuNnZORDR2NDA)
proposal use that 64-byte representation to maximize compatibility with the existing EdDSA implementations.
Our proposal differs slightly from BIP32-Ed25519 in that the private key does not carry additional 32 bytes
secret entropy just to derive the “prefix” half of the expanded key. Instead, ChainKD
derives second half of the 64-byte expanded key from the secret scalar itself, reusing its entropy
and allowing the xprv to be of the same size as xpub — only 64 bytes (scalar + derivation key).


## Security

### Capabilities

Knowledge of the seed or the root extended private key:

1. Allows deriving hardened extended private key.
2. Allows deriving non-hardened extended private key.
3. Allows signing messages with the root key.

Knowledge of an extended private key:

1. Allows deriving hardened extended private key.
2. Allows deriving non-hardened extended private key.
3. Allows signing messages with that key.

Knowledge of an extended public key:

1. Allows deriving non-hardened public keys.
2. Does not allow determining if it is derived in a hardened or non-hardened way.
3. Does not allow determining if another extended public key is a sibling of the key.
4. Does not allow signing
5. Does not allow deriving private keys.
6. Does not allow deriving hardened public keys.

Knowledge of a parent extended public key and one of non-hardened derived extended private keys:

1. Allows extracting parent private key: `s = (s’ - f) mod L` where `f` is derived from the parent `xpub` and `s’` is extracted from the child `xprv’`.

### Root key security

We set 6 bits in the secret 256 bits of a 512-bit root extended key. Therefore, the root key requires an order of 2<sup>250</sup> attempts by brute-force.

### Hardened derivation security

Private keys derived using hardened derivation have 6 bits set, just like the root key. Therefore, an extended private key requires an order of 2<sup>250</sup> attempts by brute-force.

### Non-hardened derivation security

Non-hardened derivation consist of adding scalars less that 2<sup>230</sup> (multiplied by 8) to a root private key. The resulting keys have the entropy of the root key (250 bits), but the number of possible public keys is reduced to 2<sup>230</sup> to allow large number of derivation levels. This means collisions of public keys are expected after deriving 2<sup>115</sup> keys. We note that increased probability of collisions does not reduce security of EdDSA signatures or ECDH key exchange; it only marginally reduces unlinkability safety in privacy schemes based on one-time keys.

### Secret scalar compatibility

EdDSA requires specific values for 5 bits of the secret scalar: lower 3 bits must be zero, higher 2 bits must be 1 and 0.

By setting high three bits of a root key (or hardened private key) to `010` and low three bits to `000`, that key has form `r = 2^254 + 8·k`, where maximum value  of `k` is `2^250 - 1`. Each non-hardened derived scalar `f` is generated from 230 bits and has maximum value `2^230 - 1`. Therefore a key at level `i` has maximum value `2^254 + 2^253 - 8 + i·8·(2^230 - 1)`. Since the maximum `i` equals `2^20`, maximum value of any key is `2^255 - 2^23 - 8`. As a result, all deriveable keys are less than `2^255`, larger than `2^254` and divisible by 8 as required by EdDSA.

The depth limit is reset at each level where hardened derivation is used.

### Nonce entropy

EdDSA derives a 64-byte signing key from 256 bits of entropy. In ChainKD the extended private key carries the secret scalar as-is and 32 bytes of _derivation key_. The 64-byte signing key as required by EdDSA consists of a secret scalar (unmodified) and additional 32 bytes of _prefix_ used to generate nonce for the signature.

In ChainKD that prefix is derived non-linearly from the extended private key, having the entropy of the secret scalar (250 bits). The prefix is not derived in parallel to secret scalar, but from it, making the construction similar to the one in [RFC6979](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6979) where the nonce is also computed from a secret scalar and a message using an HKDF construction.

## Acknowledgements

We thank Dmitry Khovratovich and Jason Law for thorough analysis of the previous version of this scheme and their proposal [BIP32-Ed25519](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0ByMtMw2hul0EMFJuNnZORDR2NDA) where derived keys are also safe to use in ECDH implementations using Montgomery Ladder. We improve on their proposal further by slighly reducing collision probability of child keys, reducing size of xprv from 96 to 64 bytes and using extensible output hash function SHAKE128 instead of HMAC-SHA512.

We also thank Gregory Maxwell and Pieter Wuille for clarifying design decisions behind [BIP32](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0032.mediawiki) and capability of selectively proving linkage between arbitrary child keys.

Finally, we thank all participants on the [Curves](https://moderncrypto.org/mail-archive/curves/2017/000858.html) and [CFRG](https://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/cfrg/current/msg09077.html) mailing lists: Henry de Valence, Mike Hamburg, Trevor Perrin, Taylor R. Campbell and others.
